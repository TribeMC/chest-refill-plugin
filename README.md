# Chest refill Minecraft Spigot Plugin
Allows you to create refillable chests per player. The chest contains a specific amount of a given item set and puts them in a random spot.

You can configure
- possible items in chest 
- amount of items shown to player on chest open
- delay for chest refill
- groups for chests (configure once and apply to multiple chests)
